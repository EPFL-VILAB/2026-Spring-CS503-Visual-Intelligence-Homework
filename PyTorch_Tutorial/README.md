# Pytorch Tutorial: Introduction to PyTorch

The tutorial is designed to help you become familiar with the basic concepts of PyTorch, which we will use in future projects. In the provided three notebooks, we cover the following topics:

- **01**: PyTorch Tensor Fundamentals  
- **02**: PyTorch Workflow  

By following the [tutorials](./tutorials) step by step and completing the [exercises](./exercises), you will gain a solid initial understanding of how to use PyTorch. This foundation will be valuable for any future AI-related projects.

Note that the tutorials are not mandatory if you have already familiar with PyTorch, but they are recommended to help you understand the concepts better. 

The primary resource for this tutorial is [learnpytorch.io](https://www.learnpytorch.io/), an excellent open-source website where you can explore more about PyTorch.
