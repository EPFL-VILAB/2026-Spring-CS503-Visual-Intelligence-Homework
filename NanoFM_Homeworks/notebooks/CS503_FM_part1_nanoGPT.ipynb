    "# CS 503 Foundation Models: Part 1 - nanoGPT\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, we start by implementing the necessary building blocks to construct an autoregressive Transformer, like GPT.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this first part is to familiarize yourself with the following topics:\n",
    "- Causal attention\n",
    "- Transformer decoder-only (e.g. GPT, LLaMA, ...) models\n",
    "- Basic tokenization\n",
    "- Basic positional encodings\n",
    "- Autoregressive modelling on text and images\n",
    "- Autoregressive inference\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook should give you a solid foundation of working with autoregressive Transformer models and get you \"thinking with tokens\".\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to know more about these topics, please see some of the reading material in the lectures and at the bottom of this notebook, and feel free to ask the TAs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your task is to fill in the missing code in the accompanying codebase (highlighted by `???`), run the training loops and evaluate the trained models with this notebook.\n",
    "- Submit the notebook with all cells executed.\n",
    "- The notebooks are individual homework."

    "### 3.1 Tokenization\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to turn images into sequences of discrete tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common way of performing tokenization of images is to train a discrete VAE, such as [VQ-GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09841) to autoencode images through a discrete bottleneck. This is an entire research field of its own, so we will not go further into that here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we will tokenize the images in a much simpler way:\n",
    "- First, we turn the grayscale images into black and white → each image is now a sequence of 14x14 zeros and ones. In this manner, we would already have a sequence of discrete tokens we could model, but the sequence length of 14x14=192 could be shorter.\n",
    "- To reduce the sequence length further, we divide the image into 2x2 patches and turn each of the 2x2 patterns into a unique index. If we flatten each 2x2 patch into a sequence of 4 zeros and ones, we can directly interpret them as integers between 0 and 15. This reduces the sequence length by a factor of four. Much more manageable in our toy setting!\n",
    "\n",
    "While this way of tokenizing is really quite \"toy\", it is indicative of a common problem when dealing with images and transformers: naively turning images to tokens can result in very large sequence lengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's plot some examples of the tokenized images. First is the original image, then we show each token, and finally we show the corresponding token sequence. \n",
    "The first token is the class-label, and the next 49 are the image tokens in raster-scan order. Their token id was shifted by 10 to account for the additional class token (we share the vocabulary with it)."
